Writer Top is a script that allows you to quickly find the users on your forum who have written the most posts during a specific period 
of time.   
  
To install the script, create a new page on your forum and copy the code from the "page.html" file there. Replace the forumIDs with the ids
of the forums you want to track. Do not forget to add the archive forums. Do not forget that all the forums you want to track shoould be
visible to anyone who is allowed to see the page.  
  
That's it.  
The JS code is stored remotely, you do not need to save it on your forum. Every time it is updated it will automatically update on your 
forum.
